## Overview

An automatic means of selecting 2 individual tribes that can be used when creating a hybrid character. The application itself is a learning tool to assist in basic web development. Simplicity is key.

### Backstory
A fan of the series, as well as an aspiring artist, was using a numerical list of tribes (rewritten over and over), and an online random number generator to select which tribes to merge.

As a application engineer, a webapp generator was an easy path forward. 

## Development

The basis of the app is simple HTML, CSS, and JS (HCJ). Not much more for now. The intent is to K.I.S.S.(Keep It Simple Stupid) to allow for a natrual progression of learning. 

### Simple Requirements

1. Must be pure HCJ. (Plus Bootstrap :) )
1. Offline first.
1. Host as a static site (AWS S3).
